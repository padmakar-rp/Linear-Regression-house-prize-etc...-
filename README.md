# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Linear Regression using Python and Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on property area.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Create a simple housing dataset
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize the regression results

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to regression modeling in machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## Dataset

The dataset is manually created and contains the following values:

| Area (sq ft) | Price ($) |
|--------------|----------|
| 500          | 150000   |
| 800          | 200000   |
| 1200         | 300000   |
| 1500         | 350000   |
| 2000         | 450000   |
| 2500         | 500000   |

## Methodology

1. Data preparation using Pandas
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Training a Linear Regression model
4. Making predictions on test data
5. Evaluating performance using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. Visualizing results using Matplotlib

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
